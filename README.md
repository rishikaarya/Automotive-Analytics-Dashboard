## QUESTIONS AND INTERPRETATIONS

Q1. What is the distribution of cars among different owner types?

Interpretation:

+ First-owner vehicles have the highest average selling price at ₹751,663, indicating that vehicles owned by the original buyer retain higher value.
+ Second-owner vehicles show a significant drop in average price (₹415,127), followed by third-owner vehicles (₹315,969), and fourth-and-above-owner vehicles (₹227,529).
+ This suggests a declining trend in value as the number of ownerships increases, likely due to perceived usage and wear.

Q2. What is the trend in total kilometers driven for cars of different manufacturing years?

Interpretation:

+ The bar chart reveals a trend in the number of cars driven over time, grouped by manufacturing year (2012–2020).
+ There is higher activity or usage for cars manufactured in recent years (e.g., 2018–2020), as shown by their larger contribution to total "cars driven."
+ Older cars (e.g., from 2012) show lower activity levels, possibly due to reduced use or removal from active circulation.

Q3. Which fuel type has the highest average selling price?

Interpretation:

+ The line chart demonstrates fluctuations in the average selling price over the course of the day in 30-minute intervals.
+ Peaks occur at certain times, indicating potential high-demand or active selling windows where prices are higher.
+ There is an observable dip around 17:00, suggesting reduced demand or activity during this interval.

Q4. WHich fuel type supports higher maximum power in cars?

Interpretation:

+ Vehicles with manual transmission have a higher representation (79%) and an average selling price of ₹461,779.
+ Automatic vehicles represent 21% of the data but have a higher average selling price of ₹176,3115.
+ This indicates that while manual transmission vehicles are more common, automatic transmission cars are perceived as premium and command a higher price.

Q5. How does the number of seats in a car impact its average selling price?

Interpretation:

+ Vehicles using Diesel have the highest maximum power (671 units), indicating Diesel-powered vehicles are typically more powerful.
+ Petrol vehicles rank second in terms of maximum power, with a value of 280 units.

Q13. How does the average number of kilometers driven vary between different owner types?

Interpretation:

+ Cars from the late 1990s to early 2000s had maximum power outputs below 100 BHP.
+ Post-2010, petrol cars saw a noticeable increase in power outputs, with newer models (e.g., 2015-2019) exceeding 150 BHP and even nearing 200 BHP.
+ There is a clear upward trend in power capabilities as newer models are introduced.

+ Buyers can expect comparable mileage regardless of whether they purchase from dealers, individuals, or Trustmark-certified dealers. Seller type is not a key determinant of mileage performance.

## MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS

**Pricing Strategies:**

+ Vehicles with single ownership retain higher resale value, highlighting the need to target first-owner cars for acquisition or marketing. Dealerships and individual sellers can emphasize this feature to justify premium pricing.
+ Diesel vehicles command higher average prices, reflecting their durability and efficiency. Marketing campaigns should underscore these attributes to appeal to long-term and high-mileage drivers.
+ Cars with automatic transmissions, while fewer in number, are perceived as premium and fetch higher prices. Dealerships should actively promote these vehicles to affluent or urban consumers.

**Consumer Insights:**

+ Buyers prioritize vehicles with lower ownership history, higher mileage efficiency, and powerful engine capabilities, especially for diesel variants. Targeted promotions should communicate these features to align with consumer preferences.
+ Recent models (2018–2020) are in higher demand, suggesting a shift toward newer vehicles. Dealers should invest in acquiring and advertising recent inventory.

**Product Portfolio Management:**

+ Vehicles with higher seating capacities (e.g., 7-seaters) are seen as premium offerings, appealing to families and utility-focused buyers. This segment requires targeted promotion and competitive pricing.
+ Fuel-efficient cars (above 20 kmpl), particularly diesel models, dominate the top-performing category. Focus on promoting these models to budget-conscious or environmentally aware consumers.

**Operational Optimization:**

+ Insights into the relationship between kilometers driven and ownership type can help dealerships optimize maintenance services and warranties for higher-owner-count vehicles, enhancing their resale appeal.
+ Fuel type and engine power trends indicate diesel vehicles dominate in power and performance, providing direction for service packages and maintenance offers tailored for diesel vehicle owners.

**Market Positioning:**

+ The dominance of manual transmission vehicles (79%) indicates their strong market presence. However, the premium positioning of automatic vehicles (21%) calls for differentiated marketing strategies to capture both market segments.
+ Mileage performance across seller types is consistent, meaning sellers (dealers, individuals, Trustmark-certified) should compete on factors like pricing, certifications, and added services rather than mileage performance.

**Technological Trends:**

+ Engine power evolution in petrol vehicles shows a significant increase in recent years. Automotive brands can leverage this trend to position newer models as performance-oriented while maintaining fuel efficiency.

**Sales Time Optimization:**

+ The fluctuation in selling price across time intervals suggests that sellers can optimize listings and promotions during peak demand periods to maximize returns. Analytical tools should be employed to identify and capitalize on these high-demand windows.

**Sustainability and Innovation:**

+ Lower resale values of CNG and LPG vehicles highlight potential gaps in market demand. Automotive manufacturers and marketers can explore consumer education campaigns or incentives to drive adoption of alternative fuel vehicles.
